        <p class="title-font text-2xl sm:text-4xl"> AJ Hackett International is committed to effectively managing health, safety, and welfare for all of our stakeholders. </p>
    </div>

    <p class="pb-5p sm:pb-2p"> We strive to achieve a high level of safety for our customers and crew through the following methods:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5p space-y-2 pr-5p">
        <li class="pb-1">Providing adequate control of health and safety risks arising from our work activities by complying with health and safety legislation.</li>
        <li class="pb-1">Utilizing digital platforms for scheduled inspections and maintenance to ensure the safety of plant and equipment across our sites worldwide.</li>
        <li class="pb-1">Ensuring all employees receive adequate and effective training and are competent to carry out their tasks safely.</li>
        <li class="pb-1">Prevent accidents and cases of ill health through effective risk management and hazard reporting.</li>
        <li class="pb-1">Effectively manage risks or potential incidents through the use of specialized technology and equipment, operational awareness, site design, and crisis procedures.</li>
        <li class="pb-1"> <span class="pb-1"> Maintain clean, safe, and healthy conditions for employees and customers alike.</span> <br> <span class="pb-1">The Code of Practice for Bungy Jumping, AS/NZS 5848, was developed 30 years ago by AJ Hackett in conjunction with the New Zealand and Australian governments. AJ Hackett's compliance with local legislation is complemented by our commitment to adhering to our internal company policies, operational procedures, and guidelines.</span> <br> Given the diverse range of locations and activities at each AJ Hackett site, each site operates according to site-specific operating manuals, applying the principles from these standards to safely manage and maintain all our activities.</li>
        <li class="pb-1">AJ Hackett crew members are trained to the highest standards. As they develop and progress, they must pass examinations as part of their training plans to qualify and be certified as operators for their respective activities.</li>
        <li class="pb-1">Jump crew members are trained with the goal of becoming certified AJ Hackett International Jump Masters. This training can take up to two years and adheres to the standards of Jump Master Accreditation. Once certified, they complete regular refresher courses and examinations to keep their skills sharp and up-to-date with organizational changes.</li>
        <li class="pb-1">All activity-related equipment used by AJ Hackett International is manufactured to the highest available standards. Personal protective equipment (PPE) and other operational gear must meet both local and international ratings and certifications. Critical components are designed with a minimum breaking load of 20 kN, which equates to holding over 2000 kg.</li>
        <li class="pb-1">Bungy cords are specifically manufactured for each site by AJ Hackett International. We use only the finest natural latex rubber thread, crafted using a technique passed down through generations of bungy experts and refined into the modern-day bungy cord. The rubber thread undergoes elongation and age testing at the factory to ensure that each batch we receive is highly consistent and predictable.</li>
        <li class="pb-1">Safety redundancies are built into our jump systems to provide an extra level of comfort and increased safety. This includes Bungy cords with webbing, swimming pools and water under the jump zone, and bespoke dampener systems designed specifically for use on AJ Hackett International sites.</li>
        <li class="pb-1"><strong>Medical Conditions:</strong> We request that our clients disclose any medical conditions they may have to our staff before participating in any of our adventure activities. This information is crucial to ensure the safety and suitability of the activities for each individual.</li>
